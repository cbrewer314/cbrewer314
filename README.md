- 👋 Hi, I’m @cbrewer314, a retired software engineer with most of my work using linux on medium-sized embedded systems using C/C++.
- 👀 I’m interested in just about anything to do with linux, tiny computers, amateur radio, or woodworking. Or anything that lights up. Or does unexpected interesting things. Several of these at once is a definite win!
I'm currently experimenting with PIC microcontrollers, Arduinos, ESP8266s, and Rasbperry Pis. I haven't yet worked with ESP32s or the various flavors of STM-based boards, but I'll get there eventually!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about the Raspberry Pi RP2040 with the (self-educational) goal of using one to build an inexpensive (low performance) digital oscilloscope. BECAUSE I CAN, THAT'S WHY
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on projects involving small systems that I find personally interesting.
- 📫 If anyone would ever possibly want to reach me, please beam positive vibes my way through the ionosphere while visualizing your intentions. If the ionosphere is down, though, you could also try sending email to cbrewer314 (at) gmail (dot) com.
